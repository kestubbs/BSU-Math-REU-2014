Introduction

Background
-Finite fields (construction and implementation)
-Core AES functions (MixColumns, SubBytes, ShiftRows)

Presentation of Lane
-Message Expansion
-Internal cipher
-XORing of different parts

Implementation of AES Cipher in GF(9)
--The goals of this section is to show that the conditions derived in the AES cipher paper are relevant to actual implementation--
-Show orbits of p' for mixing matrix with zeros, mixing matrix without zero, and not mixing matrix
-Show orbits of p' for subbytes with fixed points and (0xff - x) fixed points
-Show orbits of p' for ShiftRows where it doesn't go to every column but gcd is 1 and normal AES
-Show orbits of entire cipher for surjective key schedule (LSFR), with non-surjective but generates key space, and neither

Implementation of Lane in GF(9)
-Test orbits of our sufficent conditions vs more standard conditions
-Vary round leth to see if and when we get comparable orbit lengths
